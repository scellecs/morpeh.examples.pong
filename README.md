# Morpeh Pong
A pong-like game example using [Morpeh ECS framework](https://github.com/scellecs/morpeh), 
[Morpeh Globals](https://github.com/scellecs/morpeh.globals) and [Tri-Inspector](https://github.com/codewriter-packages/Tri-Inspector). \
Be aware, that was just my test job, so the project has no best practices and **must be used only as an example, not as a guide**.

## Broken [Installer] Main prefab
There's possibility to get broken links in Main Installer after import.
To solve this just right click prefab and select `Reimport` action. This action must fix links.
