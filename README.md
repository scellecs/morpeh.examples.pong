# Morpeh Pong
A pong game example using [Morpeh ECS framework](https://github.com/scellecs/morpeh),
[Morpeh Helpers](https://github.com/SH42913/morpeh.helpers). \
It contains usages of Morpeh Providers and Globals.
Be aware, that was just my test job, so the project has no best practices and **must be used only as an example, not as a guide**.

## REQUIRES ODIN INSPECTOR

If you want to clone the project and dive into it... **ODIN INSPECTOR IS REQUIRED!**

You must be aware that correct work of the project is able only with [Odin Inspector](https://odininspector.com/). I'm
unable to publish it to GitHub. So, make sure you can import Odin Inspector into the project after cloning :)
